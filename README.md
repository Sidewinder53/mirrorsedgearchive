vNext is a rebuilt version of the Mirror's Edge Archive. vNext will utilize asset bundling and more effective asset optimization to improve overall client-side rendering performance.
It will also benefit maintainers by providing templating features and dynamic layouts, which will in turn improve handling of structural changes. Build times are drastically reduced by enabling caching for CPU intensive workloads.
