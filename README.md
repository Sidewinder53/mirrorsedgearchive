This is the web code base for the Mirror's Edge Archive, which is a collection of fan projects and front-end to a comprehensive archive about the Mirror's Edge franchise.

The archive consits of high-quality photos and wallpapers, concept art, videos (like gameplay previews, trailers and developers diaries), audio (like SFX and music), developer presentations and fan-made maps as well as other resources.

Due to legal limitations the archive, which is accessible at https://archive.mirrorsedgearchive.de/, and other resources which host copyrighted content are not part of this repository.
